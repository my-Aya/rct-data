I also think it was helpful in assisting me to put myself in situations to tackle my anxiety and acted somewhat as a support and accountability. Some of it did feel a little abstract though, particularly the rumination module. The app helped me to tackle beliefs that I have, and I try to use that in daily situations and try to avoid avoiding things somewhat now.","I've been able to tackle negative beliefs. This is still a continuing journey, but that's helping me to try to avoid situations.","I think one usuful thing could be to ask at the beginning what types of situation sor scenarios that I avoid and am currently avoiding. It can then be good for the app to pick out and use those scenarios also. I can plan the situations and sometimes it can be difficult to think of a scenario in that moment when tackling each module, plus it is possible to plan a scenario which maybe doesn't challenge me enough. Therefore the option for app to maybe pick one of those or picking a pre set scenario might be useful.","I did complete them, tho sometimes more in my own time as opposed to strictly following the schedule. One thing that got in the way was just being busy in other things and maybe having the mindset of this will take a while so postponing it to later","I think the modules were very good. Particularly the initial stages where it might have been a game etc. The putting it into action sections quite similar however, perhaps a little more variety in those if possible could be helpful.",The modules on beliefs and avoidance. They helped me to realise these are big factors in my social anxiety and helped me to see things in a different way and somewhat start a journey in tackling those.,The textboxes are a bit of a pain to type in if they are on one line and the keyboard goes up on top of them so you can't easily read what you have written so far. read,I found the rumination module challenging as it all felt very abstract and it felt quite a long module.

I used an app based CBT programme in 2020 starting around May or June. Due to covid lockdown etc, I was relieved of most social requirements but it did make me realise that I was probably socially anxious, not just‘naturally shy’.","It’s hard to tell. After the initial weeks of using the app, I became really busy due to extra demands on my time for family reasons. I also had cause to be out and about more. I do feel more relaxed in some situations but I have now been taking medication for ADHD which has increased my focus. I think struggling to keep my head in one place was adding to my social difficulties. I do think that training helped me to reduce self-consciousness somewhat. Because I had no choice but to do some things, I’m not sure how well I tackled avoidance. For example, I dropped into the hairdressers and made an appointment for me and 2 of my children as I was passing . I would normally have to plan and work up to this but I really needed a haircut to avoid problems with too much pulling on my scalp while I have hair shedding going on. I was forced into the situation rather than choosing. It was also preferable to making a phone call m.","I did make myself go to a Welsh conversation zoom meet-up and enjoyed it. This was a massive win. I have joined an online book club and I am looking forward to the discussion with the others - who are all strangers as yet. I feel more comfortable being honest about situations and letting others take their response as their own, if that makes sense. I’m less likely to dwell on what people might or might not think.",Some acknowledgment that sometimes your perception of a situation is correct (maybe they really don’t like you) but that’s not a problem. Maybe it’s in there but it went over my head.,"At the time, I wasn’t having enough social contact to challenge myself m. Due to childcare responsibilities and current lack of transport, there wasn’t a great deal I could do to change that.","I think I needed to be in a different situation myself (things suddenly changed during the time I was working through the modules). I fundamentally need to stop trying to be compliant in ‘medical’ or health type situations. In the case of the app, I have been very honest in my feedback when I haven’t felt that an exercise was helpful in some way (usually when I was able to give the answer I thought was required even if I didn’t believe that answer myself.",I liked the more involved meditation or game type exercises and explanations. I think being able to give feedback has been helpful as it feels like someone is listening.,"I found in one case that the AI assessment was wrong due to other parts of my nature kicking in, disability forcing me to use my voice to avoid letting my game partner down (I can’t type accurately on a phone especially at speed).
