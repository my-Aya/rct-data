#,Please describe a type of situation that is likely to cause you to ruminate,What negative thoughts do you have after this situation?,How do these thoughts make you feel about going into a similar situation in the future?,Please choose *one* negative thought that is a judgement which you would like to balance,How much do you believe this thought?,What evidence do you have that your original thought *is* true?,"When looking for evidence in this way, we often accidentally choose beliefs rather than facts

Looking at your answer, do you think the evidence you shared is a *belief* (something you think) or an objective* fact *(something you can prove)?",What evidence do you have that your original thought *is* true?,Is there any evidence that this thought is *not* true?,Is there any evidence that this thought is *not* true?,"*Tips for creating a more balanced thought *

- The new thought can be neutral, it doesn’t have to be positive
- It can be helpful to recognise the original thought as partially true, but not the whole truth
- The new thought may be more nuanced than the original
